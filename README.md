# WGPU Simulations
A couple of particle simulations written in Python, using WGPU as the render and compute.

Includes a simulation class to make writing new simulations easier, a rewrite of my [previous simulation project in Godot](https://github.com/CatCraftYT/compute-shader-gravity), and a somewhat acceptable lava lamp simulation.
